If you use google calendars, use the "+ Google Calendar" button below to add this calendar to your list of google calendars. This way you will receive any updates that might be made to this kidical-mass ride calendar and see all the Kidical Mass ride events on your google calendar. 

You can alternatively copy individual ride events to your own personal google calendar by expanding a particular ride event and clicking "copy to my calendar". However, this method will not show any changes that might be made to the event and it is recommend to check back here in case of any changes to events.

Finally the below link to a ".ics" file can be used to import the current calendar events into your own calendar program provided it supports iCalendar specification, many do.
