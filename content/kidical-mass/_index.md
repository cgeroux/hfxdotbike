title: "Kidical Mass Halifax"
---

Kidical Mass is an international movement to create a “Kidical Mass” of families out riding their bikes together and having fun! The rides are no more than a few kilometres and should be comfortable for people of all ages and abilities. They are a youth-focused event utilizing routes that the average parent (not a regular bicycle rider) feels comfortable biking with their young children.
