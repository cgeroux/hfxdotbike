The next Kidical Mass group ride will be Sunday, August 14 at 10:30 AM. Halifax Transit will be at the meeting point with a city bus from 9:30 - 10:30 AM to give folks an opportunity to practice loading their bikes on the bus and the ride will roll out around 10:30 AM. We will meet at Isleville Park, at Isleville Street and Sebastien Street, in the Hydrostone neighbourhood. The route will be 3 km along quiet streets in the Hydrostone neighbourhood, and returning to Isleville Park at the end. The route map can be viewed here.

The ride is slow and supported by ride marshalls. The ride is planned for young kids, big kids are welcome too! Bring water and snacks for your family. The ride will start and end at a playground. There is a portable washroom at Isleville Park. Please dress for the weather. In the event of rain, we’ll try to re-schedule, but if that’s not possible, the ride will be cancelled. 

The rides are free, but please consider donating to HCC to support events like this and our advocacy work in HRM. When you register you will also be asked to review and sign our safety and liability waiver. Please ensure you've signed this online before the event. 

If you have any questions at all, please email Jen at parker.jen@gmail.com
