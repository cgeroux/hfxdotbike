Our fifth Kidical Mass group ride will be taking place on Sunday, September 18 in Dartmouth. We're going "back to school" and riding the same route we rode in July. We will meet at Crichton Park Elementary School (49 Lyngby Ave) and then will ride to the Dartmouth North Public Library (105 Highfield Park Dr). The 3.5km long ride follows local streets, with minimal hills. You can see the route here. 

There is a playground, and a field at the library. There are outdoor tables & chairs, and a portable toilet on site. Please note, the Dartmouth North library is closed on Sundays so the indoor washrooms will not be accessible on this date. Bring water and snacks for your family. Please dress for the weather. In the event of rain, we’ll try to re-schedule, but if that’s not possible, the ride will be cancelled. Cancellations due to weather will be announced via social media no later than 8:30am on the day of the event.

The rides are free, but please consider donating to HCC to support events like this and our advocacy work in HRM. When you register you will also be asked to review and sign our safety and liability waiver. Please ensure you've signed this online before the event. 

If you have any questions at all, please email Jen at parker.jen@gmail.com.
