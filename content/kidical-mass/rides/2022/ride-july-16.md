Our third Kidical Mass group ride will be taking place on Saturday, July 16 in Dartmouth. We will meet at Crichton Park Elementary School (49 Lyngby Ave) and then will ride to the Dartmouth North Public Library (105 Highfield Park Dr). The 4 km long ride follows local streets, with minimal hills. You can view the route here. 

There is a playground at the library, and washrooms are located inside the library. Bring water and snacks for your family. The ride will include a mid-point stop at a playground. Please dress for the weather. In the event of rain, we’ll try to re-schedule, but if that’s not possible, the ride will be cancelled. 

The rides are free, but please consider donating to HCC to support events like this and our advocacy work in HRM. When you register you will also be asked to review and sign our safety and liability waiver. Please ensure you've signed this online before the event.
