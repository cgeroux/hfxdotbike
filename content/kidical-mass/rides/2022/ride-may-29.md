## Ride Specific Info

Our first Kidical Mass group ride will be taking place Sunday, May 29 at 9:30 AM. We will meet at Ardmore Park and the route will be 2.5km along quiet streets to Westmount Elementary School Park. Unfortunately, the washrooms at Westmount have not been installed yet, so there will not be washrooms available.

The ride will include a mid-point stop at a playground.

When: May 29th, 2022 9:30 AM through 11:30 AM
