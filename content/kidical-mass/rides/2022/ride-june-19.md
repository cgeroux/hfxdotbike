Our second Kidical Mass group ride will be taking place Sunday, June 19 at 9:30 AM. We will meet at the Mainland Common Westridge Baseball Diamond Parking Lot, accessed from Westridge Drive. The ride will be along the Mainland Common trail (crushed gravel) to Glenbourne Park, a distance of 2.9km where we will stop for a play and to socialize. There is an intermediate/advanced bike park, a play structure and fields at Glenbourne Park. From there, folks can choose to stay and play at Glenbourne or ride back to Mainland Common. You can view the ride here. 

*Note: The trail does have a few major road crossings along the route, but we will have ride marshals to help with these. 

There are no washrooms installed at Mainland Common, but there are public washrooms at the Canada Games Centre, which is just off the trail. Bring water and snacks for your family. The ride will include a mid-point stop at a playground. Please dress for the weather. In the event of rain, we’ll try to re-schedule, but if that’s not possible, the ride will be cancelled. 

The rides are free, but please consider donating to HCC to support events like this and our advocacy work in HRM. When you register you will also be asked to review and sign our safety and liability waiver. Please ensure you've signed this online before the event.
