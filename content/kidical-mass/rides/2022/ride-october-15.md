**EVENT POSTPONED TO THE RAIN DATE, NOW SUNDAY OCTOBER 16**

Join the kidical mass cycling float in the Quiet Parade, a low-stimulation event that celebrates disability.
Jen and Jillian are excited to invite you to join kidical mass in the upcoming cycling float in Quiet Parade NOW POSTPONED TO SUNDAY OCTOBER 16 at 2pm at Needham Park! The website has loads of details, including a fairly comprehensive [access guide](https://www.msvuart.ca/exhibition/quiet-parade/).

Quiet Parade is a low-stimulation event that celebrates disability. Our float is called Flying High, a celebration of the joy, freedom & community that we find in cycling. For disabled people, a bike can be our wings. 

Whether or not you are disabled, we welcome you to participate in our float! People will participate in our float by cycling and they will decorate their cycles and/or themselves in ways that represent the feeling of “flying high” they find through cycling. 

If you would like to participate in the float and would like to decorate yourselves or your cycle, please let us [parker.jen@gmail.com](mailto:parker.jen@gmail.com). know so we can arrange for alternate ways to get art materials to you.

This event takes place in conjunction with Nocturne and the Quiet Parade. No registration is required. If you wish, you can register for a reminder email the day before.

Bring water and snacks for your family. Please dress for the weather.

The rides are free, but please consider donating to HCC to support events like this and our advocacy work in HRM. 

If you have any questions at all, please email Jen at [parker.jen@gmail.com](mailto:parker.jen@gmail.com).
