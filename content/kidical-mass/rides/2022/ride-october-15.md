Kidical Mass participated in the Quiet Parade, a part of the Nocturne Art Festival. Quiet Parade is a low-stimulation event that celebrates disability. Our float was called 'Flying High', a celebration of the joy, freedom & community that we find in cycling. For disabled people, a bike can be our wings. You can read more about the Quiet Parade [here](https://www.msvuart.ca/exhibition/quiet-parade/).
