If you ride a bike in Halifax, you know how hard it can be to do so. The infrastructure is bad and isn’t meaningfully improving anywhere near as fast as it should. You may know about the good work of organizations, like the Halifax Cycling Coalition, Welcoming Wheels, and Bike Again, which work to make it possible for more people to ride bikes.

Do you also know that there is an incredible community of folks who are trying to make it better and safer to cycle here? From folks who organize [Kidical Mass](https://cyclehalifax.ca/kidical-mass-rides/) and the [Monthly Cycle](https://www.instagram.com/themonthlycyclehfx/), to those who work behind the scenes to [make data about cycling available publicly](https://twitter.com/bikehfxstats), crowdsource locations of [bike parking](https://felt.com/map/Bike-Parking-Halifax-og4BOTBnT3OlCyAVDShLOC), or make videos to document [low-stress cycling routes](https://www.youtube.com/user/kewilson263doctor), to the community members who show up with crowbars, hedge clippers, and brooms to fix immediate problems in our poorly-maintained bike lanes.

Let’s celebrate our wonderful [#BikeHfx](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bikehfx) community with the Bicycle Mayor’s Ride! The safest place for us to ride together and socialize is the Oval, where we will gather on Saturday, September 24 (rain date: Sept 25). Drop by anytime between 10 and 11:30am. Note that the Oval doesn’t open until 12pm, so washrooms and rentals won’t be available during this time. Children are very welcome. Feel free to bring supplies to make [coffee outside](https://www.instagram.com/coffeeoutsidehfx/).

This ride is not affiliated with any organization, so no registration is required and riders accept any risks associated with attending. Please be mindful that COVID is still a major concern - you're very welcome to wear a mask during the event. Please stay home if you feel unwell.
